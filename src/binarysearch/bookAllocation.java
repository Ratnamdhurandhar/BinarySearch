//1. You are given N number of books. Every book has a number of pages.
////2. You have to allocate books to M number of students. 
//There can be many ways or permutations to do so. In each permutation, 
//one of the M students will be allocated the maximum number of pages. Out of all these permutations,
//the task is to find that particular permutation in which the maximum number of pages allocated to a student is the minimum of
//those in all the other permutations and print this minimum value.
//3. Each book will be allocated to exactly one student. Each student has to be allocated at least one book.
//4. Note: Return -1 if a valid assignment is not possible, and allotment should be in contiguous order.
//Constraints
//1 <= N <= 10^5
//1 <= A [ i ] <= 10^6
//1 <= M <= 10^5
//Sample Input
//4 number of books
//12 30 48 10
//2 number of students                       hence one will take 42 and another will take 58
//Sample Output :-
//
//58
